# PaymentSystem_SOLID

My take on refactoring the payment service class "PaymentService.cs" to refractor it applying the SOLID design principles.

There are three project

**A) PaymentSystem_Need_Refactoring:** The project which need refactoring mainly payment service (PaymentService.cs)

**B) PaymentSystem_SOLID :** The project which contains code after refactoring of payment service(PaymentService.cs) after applying the SOLID design principles.

**C) PaymentSystem.Tests :** Project containing the tests.
